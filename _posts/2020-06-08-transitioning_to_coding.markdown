Hi there! My name is Erdoan but I go by Ed. I am originally from a small country in eastern Europe called Macedonia. Fun fact about is that I love challeneges. So I moved to the states about 3 years ago and basically started a new life here.

After I adjusted to living here I wanted a new challenge so I decided to learn how to code because I've always been interested in how coding works. I made the change slowly by learning the basics through another coding app and then wanted to fully commit by joining Flatiron School. I just finished the first mile which are like the baby steps to learning how to code. I'm so happy to be here and feel that at the end of this journey I'll be ready to be a great software engineer.
