### What is React.js?
React.js is the most popular front-end framework for Web applicatoons. React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.
Today, there are many live websites using React. Not only that, but industry giants like Apple, Netflix, Paypal, and many others have also already started using React JS in their software productions.

Since so many top companies are using React JS let's talk about the cool benefits it offers.

Virtual Document Object Model

In simple language, the Virtual DOM is React’s local copy of the HTML DOM. It allows React to do its computations and skip the real DOM operations.

JSX

In React, instead of using regular JavaScript for templating, it uses JSX. JSX is a simple JavaScript that allows HTML quoting and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents. HTML syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of React Framework. We can also write in pure old JavaScript.

React Native

React has native libraries that were announced by Facebook in 2015, which provides the react architecture to native applications like IOS, Android and UPD.
React-native is a mobile apps building framework using only Javascript.

Single-Way data flow

It is also known as one-way data flow, which means the data has one, and only one way to be transferred to other parts of the application. In essence, this means child components are not able to update the data that is coming from the parent component. In React, data coming from a parent is called props.

React is very easy to learn. If you have basic understanding of JS all you have to do is:
Install React `https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html` and after the installation `https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html` for MAIN CONCEPTS and follow the lessons. Just follow the examples and tutorials you will start learning React quicker than you thought.
