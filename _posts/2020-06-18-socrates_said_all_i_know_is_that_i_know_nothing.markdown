 This quote means a lot to me.
Two months ago when I have started with my first coding steps everything was just like when you look at the sky you can see nothing but the stars.
Codes were the stars, they look good but strange. 
Today, I have my first project done and I feel like I have started to have a better understanding about coding.

My Cli project is about a Cocktail program. No one can remember everything, but we have this bartender where he has no internet and has to craft specific cocktails and that’s where he can get help by my cocktail program.
He can get information about the glass type, ingredients and instructions.
This was a huge step for me and I believe that I’m going to take even bigger steps!


But I will never forget that Socrates said, "All I know is that I know nothing”
To me this means there is always something to learn no matter how much you know!! 
Then, lets continue with learning what’s the next project ? :D
